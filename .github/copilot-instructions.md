# Project Guidelines

## Code Style

- Use Python code consistent with the existing `src/player/*.py` modules: small helpers, explicit names, and dataclasses for persisted state.
- When a feature starts mixing UI flow, persistence, parsing, and external-service logic, split it into focused modules or mixins instead of extending a catch-all file.
- Keep user-facing labels, menu text, status messages, and screen reader announcements in Portuguese.
- Prefer small, targeted edits over broad refactors in the `src/player/frames/*.py` modules; `frames/base.py` coordinates the window and composes focused mixins.

## Architecture

- Entry flow is `src/main.py` -> `src/player/app.py` -> `src/player/frames/base.py`.
- Keep responsibilities separated:
	- `frames/base.py` for the main window shell and mixin composition
	- `frames/youtube_music.py` for YouTube Music auth/menu flows and background-task orchestration
	- `frames/ui.py` for menus, layout, control setup, and UI bindings
	- `frames/commands.py` for file dialogs, open/save actions, and command handlers
	- `frames/playback.py` for MPV backend setup, playback control, and progress updates
	- `frames/library.py` for composing library-related mixins and shared library-facing behavior
	- `frames/library_tabs.py` for playlist tabs, screen tabs, close/select logic, and playlist ordering behavior
	- `frames/library_loader.py` for background loading of folders and playlists
	- `frames/library_navigation.py` for folder navigation, browser refresh, and open flows
	- `frames/update.py` for startup/manual update checks and update-install flow orchestration
	- `frames/session.py` for session capture and restore
	- `frames/recents.py` for recent items and default path helpers
	- `frames/equalizer.py` for equalizer screen state, preset management, and tab integration
	- `library/open_dialog.py` for the open-source dialog and source-mode helpers
	- `library/browser.py` for playlist/folder browser UI and keyboard navigation
	- `equalizer/models.py` for equalizer constants, dataclasses, and normalization helpers
	- `equalizer/backend.py` for equalizer preset catalog helpers and MPV filter generation
	- `equalizer/dialog.py` for the equalizer preset editing dialog
	- `equalizer/panel.py` for the equalizer tab UI
	- `playlists/models.py` for playlist/tab state and playback-order behavior
	- `playlists/titles.py` for playlist and folder tab naming helpers
	- `library/media_scan.py` for supported-media checks and folder scanning helpers
	- `library/playlist_io.py` for `.m3u` / `.m3u8` loading and saving
	- `preferences/dialog.py` for the preferences UI
	- `preferences/models.py` for durable user preference models
	- `preferences/storage.py` for reading and writing `settings.json`
	- `session.py` for restorable session state in `session.json`
	- `accessibility.py` for screen reader announcements and custom `wx.Accessible` helpers
	- `youtube_music/service.py` for the YouTube Music service facade used by frame mixins
	- `youtube_music/auth.py` for browser-auth parsing, normalization, and storage helpers
	- `youtube_music/playlists.py` for YouTube Music playlist and mix normalization plus source helpers
	- `youtube_music/streams.py` for `yt-dlp` stream resolution
	- `youtube_music/models.py` for small shared YouTube Music data containers
	- `update/service.py` for GitHub release discovery, download, checksum validation, and updater launch
	- `update/dialog.py` for the update/changelog dialogs and download progress UI
- Do not mix durable preferences with session restoration logic; preserve the separation between `preferences/` and `session.py`.

## Build and Test

- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` in a virtual environment.
- Run the app with `python src/main.py`.
- Use `python -m compileall src` as the quick validation step after Python changes.
- There is no automated test suite yet, so for UI changes do a focused manual check of the affected keyboard flows, dialogs, playlist behavior, and announcements.
- The app depends on an MPV runtime being available on the system or bundled locally.
- For packaged Windows updater work, use `scripts/build_windows_release.ps1` for a local build and `docs/update-testing.md` for the end-to-end validation checklist.

## Conventions

- This project is keyboard-first and accessibility-first. Preserve existing shortcuts and avoid introducing mouse-only flows.
- Do not force focus changes in dialogs, tab switches, or auxiliary windows unless explicitly requested.
- When touching accessibility, prefer the existing helpers in `src/player/accessibility.py` and keep optional `accessible-output2` integration defensive.
- Preserve behavior that avoids noisy focus on the native video output area.
- Before adding a large behavior block to an existing player module, check whether it crosses UI, service, parsing, or playback boundaries; if it does, extract a focused module first.
- When changing preferences or session behavior, keep storage paths and JSON formats backward-compatible whenever practical.
- Keep the updater contract aligned across `src/player/constants.py`, `.github/workflows/release-windows.yml`, and release assets: the packaged updater expects `MediaPlayer-windows.zip`, the matching `.sha256`, and `MediaPlayerUpdater.exe`.
- The update dialog shows the GitHub release body as the user-facing changelog for a new version; when working on releases or docs, keep `CHANGELOG.md` and the published release notes consistent instead of assuming the app reads the changelog file directly.
- Preserve the test override environment variables `MEDIA_PLAYER_UPDATE_REPOSITORY_OWNER` and `MEDIA_PLAYER_UPDATE_REPOSITORY_NAME` so updater testing can target a separate repository.
- For large new features, after implementation and validation, ask the user whether they want you to create a Git commit before committing anything.
- When the user wants a commit for a large new feature, use a semantic commit message in Conventional Commits style (for example `feat: ...`) and perform the push after the commit.
- For the full feature list and shortcut inventory, see `README.md` instead of duplicating that content here.

## Related Customizations

- Use `.github/instructions/player-architecture.instructions.md` when editing `src/player/*.py`, splitting large modules, or adding new integrations so responsibilities stay separated.
- Use `.github/instructions/player-ui-a11y.instructions.md` when editing wxPython UI, dialogs, menus, keyboard shortcuts, focus handling, playlist browser, or screen reader accessibility.
- Use `.github/instructions/update-release.instructions.md` when editing the updater, Windows release packaging, GitHub release notes, or `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use `.github/instructions/git-workflow.instructions.md` when finalizing a large feature, preparing a commit, or pushing repository changes.
- Use `.github/prompts/accessibility-smoke-test.prompt.md` for a focused post-change accessibility verification pass after UI or accessibility work.
