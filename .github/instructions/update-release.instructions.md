# Update and Release Workflow Guidelines

- Keep versioning and release metadata coherent across `src/player/constants.py` (`APP_VERSION`), `CHANGELOG.md`, and the GitHub release/tag being prepared.
- The in-app update dialog shows the GitHub release body (`releases/latest`) as the changelog text for the new version; do not assume the packaged app reads `CHANGELOG.md` directly.
- Preserve the release asset contract expected by `src/player/update/service.py`: `MediaPlayer-windows.zip`, `MediaPlayer-windows.zip.sha256`, and `MediaPlayerUpdater.exe` for packaged Windows installs.
- Keep checksum validation and packaged-updater-only behavior intact; automatic installation is only supported for the frozen Windows build.
- Preserve the environment variable overrides `MEDIA_PLAYER_UPDATE_REPOSITORY_OWNER` and `MEDIA_PLAYER_UPDATE_REPOSITORY_NAME` so updater tests can target a separate repository.
- When updating release/testing guidance, link to `docs/update-testing.md` for the full end-to-end checklist and to `CHANGELOG.md` for version history instead of duplicating long procedures.
- After touching the updater, release packaging, or changelog-related Python files, run `python -m compileall src`; for packaging changes, also confirm whether `README.md` or `docs/update-testing.md` needs a matching documentation update.
