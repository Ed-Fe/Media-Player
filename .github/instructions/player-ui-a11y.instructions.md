# Player UI and Accessibility Guidelines

- Keep all user-facing text in Portuguese, including menu items, dialog labels, status messages, and screen reader announcements.
- Preserve the keyboard-first design. Do not introduce mouse-only flows, and keep existing shortcuts stable unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Do not force focus changes in dialogs, tab switches, playlist views, or auxiliary windows unless the request explicitly asks for it.
- Reuse the helpers and patterns in `src/player/accessibility.py` before introducing new accessibility abstractions.
- Keep screen reader integration defensive: `accessible-output2` is optional, so new code must continue to behave safely when it is unavailable.
- Preserve the behavior that avoids noisy focus on the native VLC output area.
- For preference or dialog changes, prefer small helpers and explicit control names/help text so labels remain clear for assistive technologies.
- For shortcut inventories and feature behavior, link to `README.md` instead of duplicating long documentation inside code comments or instructions.
- After UI or accessibility changes, do a focused manual check of the affected keyboard navigation, announcements, and dialog behavior, then run `python -m compileall src` as a quick validation step.
